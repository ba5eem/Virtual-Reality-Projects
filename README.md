# Virtual Reality
VR Apps Repo - Check out the different folders for code samples and getting started examples

FYI: If your developing [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) - You have to use [Mozilla Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) browser - as it will allow you to run the VR app on [Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro/), [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/rift/) and others. You can enable [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) under chrome://flags - but this didnt work for me.  [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) also supports [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) - but it had lag issues that [Mozilla Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) didnt have. [Sevro](https://servo.org/) browser also is said to support [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) - but I had installation issues, and [Mozilla Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) worked fine for my needs.

VR Hardware: [Vive Pro](https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro/)
