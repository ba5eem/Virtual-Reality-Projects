# Virtual Reality
VR Apps Repo - Check out the different folders for code samples and getting started examples

FYI: If your developing WebVR - You have to use Firefox Nightly browser - as it will allow you to run the VR app on [Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro/), Oculus and others. You can enable webVR on Chrome under chrome://flags - but this didnt work for me.  Chromium also supports webVR - but it had lag issues that Firefox didnt have. Sevro browser also is said to support webVR - but I had installation issues, and Firefox worked fine for my needs.
